<h2>What is minimega?</h2>
<p>minimega is a tool for launching and managing virtual machines. It can run on your laptop or distributed across a cluster. minimega is fast, easy to deploy, and can scale to run on massive clusters with virtually no setup.</p>

<p>OpenStack and other VM-management tools need lots of configuration <b>and</b> they're still slow! minimega requires no configuration beyond a few optional command line arguments--it can even deploy itself to other cluster nodes if needed. It launches VMs fast, too; in a few seconds, you can launch and start as many VMs as your physical memory can hold--but thanks to minimega's KSM integration, duplicated memory pages will be compressed and you can start even more VMs!</p>

<p>The minimega repository also includes <a href="/tools.html">several more tools</a> and libraries to make VM creation and cluster management easier</p>
