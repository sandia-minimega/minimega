			<h2>What is minimega?</h2>
			<p>minimega is a tool for launching and managing virtual machines. It can run distributed across a cluster, or on a laptop. minimega is fast, easy to deploy, and can scale to run across massive clusters.</p>

			<p>OpenStack and other VM-management tools need lots of configuration <b>and</b> they're still slow! minimega requires no configuration beyond a few optional command line arguments, and it launches VMs fast. In seconds, you can launch and start as many VMs as your physical memory can hold--but thanks to minimega's KSM integration, duplicated memory will be compressed and you can start even more VMs.</p>

			<p>The minimega repository also includes <a href="/tools.html">several more tools</a> and libraries to make VM creation and cluster management easier</p>
