minimega 2.7 release notes

* Introduction

The minimega team is pleased to announce the release of minimega 2.7. This 
release includes several new features and bug fixes as well as updates to 
support the latest dependency packages. This release introduces igor web, a web
UI similar to miniweb that allows easy use of the igor command-line tool. This 
release also includes the addition of the minibuilder UI to the miniweb 
front-end allowing rapid configuration and deployment of virtual machines and a 
suite of training modules that cover nearly every tool in the minimega suite, 
which can be found on minimega.org/training.

* What's New?

** Major Changes and Milestones


*** minibuilder: A UI for minimega

minibuilder allows the user to quickly and easily design and configure VM
networks using a web interface built into miniweb. 

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1429][#1429]]


*** mini101: Training course for minimega

This PR represents a full course series on using minimega, comprised of 15 
modules that cover nearly every aspect of using minimega and its various tools. 

Training course modules can be found at 
[[https://minimega.org/training][minimega.org/training]].

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1404][#1404]].


*** igorweb: A web interface to igor

`igorweb` allows users to create/modify/delete `igor` reservations using a 
friendly web interface. It has all of the functionality of `igor` in a shiny 
package.

`igorweb` is its own package separate from `igor` and issues commands to `igor`. 
So, `igor` works without `igorweb`, but `igorweb` can't work without `igor`.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1371][#1371]].


*** Upgraded dependency packages

minimega now runs with `Go` 1.12+. Older versions of `Go` are no longer 
supported. Upgrades to

- `jQuery` (3.1.1 -> 3.4.1)
- `dataTables` (1.10.12 -> 1.10.20)
- `bootstrap` (3.3.5 -> 4.3.1)

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1409][#1409]], 
PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1382][#1382]].

README with details

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1428][#1428]]


*** vncdrone: Improved VNC automation

Support for phases of execution and better name matching. Allows the user to 
specify various workloads and randomize work depending on stage (login stage, 
work stage, logout) For example, you can have a drone 

- login 
- randomly pick vnc files to do work
- log out 

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1406][#1406]].


** Additional New Features


*** minimega: Specify `flush` targets

This PR Changes 'all' VM flush method to 'FlushAll()'.
- Created new 'Flush()' method that uses the 'Apply' method to flush a specified 
  target.
- Updated help strings to reflect enhancement.
- Backwards compatible with old `vm flush` behavior

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/issues/1392][#1392]].


*** minimega: use "actual path" from qemu-img for backing image if present

If you run qemu-img info in the same directory as the image you're passing to it 
then the (actual path: ...) item isn't included in the output. However, if you 
run qemu-img info from a different directory, or you pass the absolute path of 
the image to qemu-img info, then the (actual path: ...) item is present. 
minimega always passes the full path of a disk image to qemu-img info.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/issues/1437][#1437]].


*** minimega: package python bindings

Packaging the minimega python bindings would allow users to easily install them 
into their python environments with pip.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1415][#1415]].


*** minimega: create minimega group in deb package and use it in init script

This allows users to run minimega commands without needing to be root by 
creating a "minimega" group. All users that are part of the "minimega" group 
can execute commands.

This is achieved by running the following after starting minimega:

  chgrp -R minimega $MM_RUN_PATH
  chmod -R g=u $MM_RUN_PATH
  chmod g+s $MM_RUN_PATH ${MM_RUN_PATH}/minimega
  
in the systemctl script or by minimega on startup.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1414][#1414]].


*** minimega: vm net add

Adding `vm net add` command which allows the user to hotplug a nic to a kvm, and 
specify some attributes - bridge, vlan, mac, and driver
- Does not work for containers
- Does not include the remove feature

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1363][#1363]].


*** igor: Specify VLAN for a reservation 

Allows users to specify which VLAN they'd like a reservation to connect to. 
`-vlan `can be specified for `sub` and `edit`

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1369][#1369]].


*** igor: Pause activity

Adds the ability to pause `igor` activity. When igor is paused, attempts to 
`sub`, `show`, `del`, or other commands will fail and display a configurable 
message. `igorweb` will display the same message.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1403][#1403]].


*** igor: Enhanced logging

Logging now include all relevant reservation information

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1395][#1395]], 
PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1399][#1399]].


*** igor: extend clarification

Clarifying logs for extend when duration exceeds limits. Before, the message 
indicated that the user request more time than specified in their command 
because we were adding it to the time remaining in their reservation. Now, we 
specify that the requested time, plus the time remaining, is what exceeds the 
limit.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1432][#1432]]


* Bug Fixes


** minimega 


*** Fixed issue adding virtual network interfaces to newer Ubuntu distribution 
containers. 

On newer distros, `ip link add` actually respects the `iface` name 
given within the container `netns`, whereas it didn't before and just gave the 
`vethX` as expected.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1378][#1378]].


*** Fixed error checking on '`vm config net`' when only using containers

Throws warning instead of an error when running just with containers (no 
installation of `kvm/qemu`) 

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1380][#1380]].


*** Fixed vm name check for rtunnel

Fixes issue with reverse tunnel error by changing when the name check for a VM 
occurs.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/issues/1384][#1384]].


*** QOS Update

Clarification for qos help and fixed an issue with burst computation where 
setting rate to kbits would result in a 0 burst value, causing an error in TC.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1381][#1381]].


*** minimega.namespace_cli: don't use loopback addresses for GRE tunnels

This prohibits loopback addresses from being used as endpoints in bridges in 
cliNamespaceBridge in minimega.namespace_cli.go.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1419][#1419]].


** igor


*** Don't uninstall / clear network settings when deleting future reservation

Fixes an issue where deleting future reservations clobbers network settings for 
active reservations.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1391][#1391]].


*** Allow uninstall/clear for expired reservations

Fixes an issue where the network is not cleared when a reservation expires.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1401][#1401]].


*** Fix for the igor stats test to avoid issues with Daylight Savings Time

The stats test was failing (twice a year, it would seem) due to time changes 
affecting test outcome.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1405][#1405]].



** miniweb


*** Forcing the href update before reload as the order of operations is 
otherwise not guaranteed.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1364][#1364]].


** misc


*** ldd.go

ubuntu 16.04 gives different output for ldd from ubuntu 18.04 this quick change 
makes it so you can build containers on 16.04

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1426][#1426]].


*** Update so git treats build artifacts of uminirouter as ignored.

Changed perms on build.bash files from 664 to 775 so users don't get a git 
modified flag upon changing it themselves.

PR [[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2/pull/1417][#1417]].


* Availability

minimega is available in several ways, both as pre-built distributions and 
source. See the [[https://minimega.org/articles/installing.article][installing]] 
guide for more information.

** Debian package
minimega is available as an x86-64 debian package, available 
[[https://storage.googleapis.com/minimega-files/minimega-2.7.deb][here]]. It is 
known to work in debian 9 (stretch) and ubuntu 16.04. It is known not to work on 
debian 10 (buster).

** tarball
A pre-built, x86-64 distribution is available in a single distributable tarball 
here. It should be sufficient to simply unpack the tarball and run tools from 
the `bin/` directory directly. Most default paths in minimega, vmbetter, and 
other tools are built to be used in this way (i.e. `bin/minimega`, which will 
then look for the web directory in `misc/web`).

** Building from source
Source of the entire distribution is available on 
[[https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega/v2][Github]]. Follow the directions 
for cloning or forking minimega on github.com. In order to build minimega, you 
will need a Go 1.12+ compiler and libpcap headers.
