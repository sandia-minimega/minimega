Creating routers with minimega

* Introduction

`minirouter` is a simple tool, run in a VM, that orchestrates various router
functions such as DHCP, DNS, IPv4/IPv6 assignments, and, of course, routing.
The `minirouter` tool is interfaced by minimega's `router` API, described
below, and the minimega distribution provides a prebuilt `minirouter` container
image. 

`minirouter` currently supports several protocols and capabilities including
DHCP, DNS, router advertisements, OSPF, and static routes. It can route in
excess of 40 gigabit when running as a container.

* Obtaining a minirouter image

** Prebuilt container image

A prebuilt, busybox-based, container image is available
[[https://storage.googleapis.com/minimega-files/minimega-2.3-minirouter.tar.bz2][here]].
This image can be built using the build script in `misc/minirouter` in the
minimega repo. The minirouter image is configured to start miniccc and
minirouter at startup.

** Building a `minirouter` image

`minirouter` can run on bare metal, as a container, or a KVM image. To use
minirouter, you must have the miniccc agent running, and minirouter must be
able to access the miniccc tool and files directory (see `minirouter`-h` for
default paths). 

`minirouter` uses `iptool`, `dnsmasq`, `dhclient`, and `bird`, all of which
must be installed but not already running. `minirouter` must run as root. 

Beyond these few requirements, `minirouter` should run on most linux systems. 

* Starting minirouter

VMs running the `minirouter` tool must have `miniccc` running as well (this is
already configured in the prebuilt `minirouter` image). Configuring a
`minirouter` image is similar to describing and launching a VM in minimega. One
first describes the router parameters, and then commits the configuration,
which causes the minirouter tool to set IPs and start other necessary tools on
the router VM. `minirouter` VMs must be running before configuring the router,
and configurations can be updated at runtime.

The `router` API requires a VM name or ID when configuring a router. For
example, to set a static IP on a running `minirouter` VM named 'foo':

	router foo interface 0 10.0.0.1/24
	router foo commit

While the first command above sets the configuration for the router image, the
second line actually commits the configuration by sending commands to
minirouter over the command and control layer in minimega. Multiple
configuration commands can be issued and then later committed with a single
`commit` command.

* Interfaces

Routers often have statically assigned IP addresses and `minirouter`
supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address specification using the `interface` API.
For example, to add the IP 10.0.0.1/24 to the second interface on a
`minirouter` VM:

	vm config net a b
	
	# add an ip to interface b (index 1)
	router foo interface 1 10.0.0.1/24

Multiple addresses can be added to the same interface as well:

	router foo interface 0 10.0.0.1/24
	router foo interface 0 2001:1::1/64

* DHCP and DNS

We use [[http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html][dnsmasq]] to provide
DHCP, router advertisements, and DNS capabilities in `minirouter`. dnsmasq has
extensive support for various DHCP and DNS options, and `minirouter` uses a
subnet of common capabilities. 

** DHCP

`minirouter` supports DHCP assignment of connected clients and supports both IP
range and static IP assignment. `minirouter` also supports several DHCP
options such as setting the default gateway and nameserver.

For example, to serve the IP range 10.0.0.2 - 10.0.0.254 on a 10.0.0.0/24
network, specify the network prefix and DHCP range:

	router foo dhcp 10.0.0.0 range 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.254

You can also specify static IP assignments with a MAC/IP address pair:

	router foo dhcp 10.0.0.0 static 00:11:22:33:44:55 10.0.0.100

Additionally, you can specify the default gateway and nameserver:

	router foo dhcp 10.0.0.0 router 10.0.0.254
	router foo dhcp 10.0.0.0 dns 8.8.8.8

All of these DHCP options can be used together in a single DHCP specification,
and multiple DHCP servers can be specified on a single `minirouter` instance
(for serving DHCP on multiple interfaces/networks).

** IPv6 Router Advertisements

`minirouter` supports IPv6 router advertisements using the Neighbor Discovery
Protocol to enable
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Stateless_address_autoconfiguration_.28SLAAC.29][SLAAC]]
addressing. To enable route advertisements simply provide the subnet. Only the
subnet prefix is required as SLAAC addressing requires a /64 and is implied.

	router foo ra 2001:1:2:3::

** DNS

`minirouter` provides a simple mechanism to add `A` or `AAAA` records for
any host/IP (including IPv6) pair. Simply specify the host and IP address of
the record:

	router foo dns 1.2.3.4 foo.com

* Routing

`minirouter` uses the [[http://bird.network.cz/][bird routing daemon]] to
provide routing using a variety of protocols. Currently, `minirouter` only
supports static and OSPF routes. Support BGP and others are planned.

Bird is a lightweight routing daemon that scales well. In our tests we were
able to scale minirouter with bird to at least 40 gigabit.

** Static routes

`minirouter` makes possible adding IPv4 or IPv6 static routes by simply
specifying the destination network and net-hop IP. For example, to add a static
IPv4 route for the 1.2.3.0/24 network via 1.2.3.254:

	router foo route static 1.2.3.0/24 1.2.3.254

IPv6 routes are added in the same way:

	router foo route static 2001:1:2:3::/64 2001:1:2:3::1

** OSPF

`minirouter` provides basic support for OSPF and OSPFv3 (IPv6 enabled OSPF) by
specifying the OSPF area and *interface* to include in the area. OSPF generally
supports specifying networks and many other options, which `minirouter` may add
in the future. For now, specifying an interface (and all of the networks on
that interface) is provided. Both OSPF and OSPFv3 are enabled by `minirouter`. 

Interfaces are identified by the index in which they were added by the
`vm`config`net` API. For example, to add the first and third network of the
router VM to area 0 in an OSPF route:
	
	vm config net a b c
	
	# add interface 'a', index 0
	router foo route ospf 0 0
	
	# add interface 'c', index 2
	router foo route ospf 0 2
