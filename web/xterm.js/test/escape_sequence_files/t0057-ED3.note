Xterm behaves oddly with CSI 3 J.  This function is supposed to clear the
saved lines in history.  Xterm does this, but a small number of lines of
history are not cleared.  The number seems to vary with how high the window is
and how much output has recently been saved.  There is no reason to simulate
this behavior, so the expected outputs are as if the entire history was
erased.
