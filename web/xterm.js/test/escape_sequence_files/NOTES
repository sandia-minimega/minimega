All tests are made for 80x25 terminal. Make sure to run tests with 80x25.

Create .text files from xterm (expected output)
- open xterm
- resize xterm to 80x25
- run `python run_tests.py`
- copy & paste whole window output into editor
- add 26th empty line (due to line handling in toString) - not a bug, a feature ;)
- advance to next test with ^D
